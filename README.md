Playground repository containing collection of algorithms written in Go.

## Algorithms

### Sorting

1. [Bubble](https://github.com/bartossh/AlGo/blob/main/bubblesort/bubblesort.go) - bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm with O (n2) time complexity
2. [Insert](https://github.com/bartossh/AlGo/blob/main/insertionsort/insertionsort.go) - insertion sort is simple sorting algorithm with  O (n) time complexity
3. [Bucket](https://github.com/bartossh/AlGo/blob/main/bucketsort/bucketsort.go) - bucket sort uses insertion sort for sorting bucket that are in increasing order, best time complexity is O(n+k), average O(n)
